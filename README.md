🚗 Summer Analytics 2025 – Week 1 Assignment (IIT Guwahati)
Welcome to my Week 1 submission for the Summer Analytics 2025 course by IIT Guwahati!
In this assignment, I explored the classic Auto MPG dataset, which includes information about 398 cars with the following attributes:

Dataset Columns:

mpg (Miles Per Gallon)

cylinders

displacement

horsepower

weight

acceleration

model_year

origin

name

🔍 What I Did
Loaded and cleaned the dataset using pandas

Handled missing values (especially in horsepower)

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and trends

Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

Conducted correlation analysis to study the relationship between features and fuel efficiency

💡 Key Insights
Vehicles with higher weight and displacement tend to have lower mpg

Horsepower also impacts mpg but shows a slightly weaker correlation

The analysis highlights how vehicle attributes have evolved over model years
